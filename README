                     "wc -l" for the impatient


wcl is a replacement for "wc -l" useful for interactive use
with large data files. Like "wc -l" it counts the number of lines
in files and displays the total. Unlike "wc -l", wcl displays a progress 
meter and an estimate of the total number of lines as it progresses.

While in progress, it looks like this:

  $ wcl aaaaaaaaaaaaa.dat bbbbbbbbbbbb.dat ccccccccc.dat
  31,261,832 aaaaaaaaaaaaa.dat
   11% [bbbbbbbbbbbb.dat] projected line count: 443,486,924

When complete, it looks like this:

  $ wcl aaaaaaaaaaaaa.dat bbbbbbbbbbbb.dat ccccccccc.dat
    31,261,832 aaaaaaaaaaaaa.dat
   167,622,458 bbbbbbbbbbbb.dat
   244,602,594 ccccccccc.dat
   443,486,884 total


INSTALLATION
------------

Requires a standard installation of OCaml.

PREFIX and BINDIR are supported, so if you want to install wcl in /usr/local,
just do:

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- no support for files over 1GB on 32-bit platforms
